[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

`Simple-GraphQL` generates [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) schemas and [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) models from your models definition(support [FlowType](https://flow.org/) static type check). The generated GraphQL schema is compatible with [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

>[GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. 

>[Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) is a promise-based ORM for Node.js. It supports the dialects `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQLite` and `MSSQL` and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

>[FlowType](https://flow.org/) is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It does a lot of work to make you more productive. Making you code faster, smarter, more confidently, and to a bigger scale.
